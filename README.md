# world-of-kata
Programming practice. Tour the world, simulating interesting experiences! Super combo attack for more special!

### Plans:
 - organize by kata, not by date
 - tag after each day of kata 
 - make Laravel, React, vanilla JS versions of each project.
 - make vagrant box for each dev environment
 - include tests for various browsers -- especially screenreader
 - make up a better kata than elevator simulator.

### Elevator Plans:
 - accessibility
 - simulated users
 - elevator breakdowns handled nicely
