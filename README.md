# world-of-kata
Programming practice. Tour the world, simulating interesting experiences! Super combo attack for more special!

### Plans:
 - choose a daily starting point.
 - organize by kata, not by date.
   - tag after each day of kata.
   - create starting point that I start from for each kata.
 - make Laravel, React, vanilla JS versions of each project.
 - make vagrant box for each dev environment.
 - include tests for various browsers -- especially screenreader.
 - make up a better kata than elevator simulator.
   - Something that works as a week-long project.
   - Something that works as a 10 min project.
      - Google clone.
      - Something where I have to type 60 wpm for 1 min of it.
 - add offline docs for all the tools I'm using.
 - create Anki/flashcards where it is more efficient than kata.
 - find ways to monitor my work and push myself in new ways (a report about my wpm, a quiz based on code from a project I follow...).

### Elevator Plans:
 - accessibility
 - simulated users
 - elevator breakdowns handled nicely
 - 3d version
 - New elevator scenarios and installations
   - 1 elevator, 1 button panel
   - 2 elevators, 2 button panel
   - elevator back door for certain floors
   - multiple panels
   - more floors
   - more users
   - space elevator
   - wonka glass elevator
   - express elevator only stops at certain floors
   - every elevator in the whole world
     - Pokemon Go game where you get points for riding elevators
   - a fun starting point:
     - the page loads to an infinite scrolling animation where you're walking down an apartment hallway, passing other apartments. The bottom of the screen tells your backstory about which apartment you just came from, what are doing right now, who you are, etc. Press any key to continue. Then you arrive at the elevator.
