# world-of-kata
Programming practice. Tour the world, simulating interesting experiences! Super combo attack for more special!

### Plans:
 - organize by kata, not by date.
   - tag after each day of kata.
 - make Laravel, React, vanilla JS versions of each project.
 - make vagrant box for each dev environment.
 - include tests for various browsers -- especially screenreader.
 - make up a better kata than elevator simulator.
 - add offline docs for all the tools I'm using.
 - create Anki/flashcards where it is more efficient than kata.

### Elevator Plans:
 - accessibility
 - simulated users
 - elevator breakdowns handled nicely
